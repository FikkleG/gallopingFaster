This project is modified based on mit-biomimetics open source project (https://github.com/mit-biomimetics/Cheetah-Software).

(2)
At present, the framework is suitable for SDUog-24, SDUog-48 and SDUog-160 robots (this project is for sduog-160).
Some functions such as frontflip, backflip are developed for SDUog-24. We don't think there is much transplantation value on large robots. All source codes are open source, but these functions cannot be realized on other physical platforms other than SDUog-24. If you are interested in these cool features, please use SDUog-24 robot or simulation environment to enjoy these functions.

 We strive to make minimal changes in mit-biomimetics open source algorithm to achieve stable motion, so as to provide a general platform for university robot developers and robot enthusiasts. You can read their paper to learn the theoretical knowledge of this project.

(4)For the consideration of (3), the open source code is a simplified version for easy reading, learning and use. The controller files corresponding to the advanced functions, such as high dynamic motion of robot, complex ground adaptive motion, terrain sense and autonomous motion based on visual, will be provided in the form of executable files and updated continuously.
