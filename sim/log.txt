add new terrain SHAKE,
you can add it in ../config/*.terrain.yaml as:

#shake1:			
#    type: "shake"		#type
#    mu: 0.5			
#    restitution: 0.0
#    period: 1000		#the true period of shaking will be 2000, double of 1000, this is lowest -> highest, a whole period alse including highest -> lowest
#    position: [0, 5.5,1.477]	#the center of shaking


the shape and ori of shaking plane is fixed,you can change it in code.
and now the shaking is liner, you can change it in simulation.h/buildShake(), make shake to be whatever you want.
